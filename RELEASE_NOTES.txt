RELEASE NOTES FOR v0.2
----------------------

Compter version 0.2 adds a number of new useful functions to the 
program:

* You can now calculate frequencies rather than enrichments by
  setting the --background option to 'none'

* You can choose to not cluster the columns of the plot by setting
  the --nogroup option

* You can output to svg instead of png by setting the --svg option

NOTE: There is a bug in older versions of R which means the --svg
option may crash R on some platforms.  If compter fails when using
--svg put works when outputting PNG files then try updating to
R >=3.4.0 to fix this.

Also note that for large datasets the size of SVG files produced 
by the program might be quite large (many megabytes).  There's not
much we can do about this - there are a lot of objects to draw and
SVG is a chatty language.


RELEASE NOTES FOR v0.1.1
------------------------

This is a bugfix release which fixes a display bug which caused the 
scale bar on the heatmap to be reversed.  The calculated enrichment
values in the text output were correct, but the values shown in the 
plot were all inversed (enriched was shown as depleted and vice versa)



RELEASE NOTES FOR v0.1
----------------------

This is the initial release of the software.  All major functions are
present and the program works successfully on our test data and on 
several other projects we've tried it on.  It's ready for wider testing.
