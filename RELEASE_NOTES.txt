RELEASE NOTES FOR v0.1.1
------------------------

This is a bugfix release which fixes a display bug which caused the 
scale bar on the heatmap to be reversed.  The calculated enrichment
values in the text output were correct, but the values shown in the 
plot were all inversed (enriched was shown as depleted and vice versa)



RELEASE NOTES FOR v0.1
----------------------

This is the initial release of the software.  All major functions are
present and the program works successfully on our test data and on 
several other projects we've tried it on.  It's ready for wider testing.
