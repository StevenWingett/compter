# Compter
Compter is a program which allows you to visually explore the sequence composition of one or more sets of DNA sequences.

The program divides your sequences into Kmers - short subsequences of a fixed length.  For each of these it calculates the frequency with which the Kmer is observed in each sequence and also works out whether this is enriched or depleted compared to a theoretical background population.

The program then plots the results for all sequences as a heatmap, and annotates this with any sequence groupings you've provided so you can see to what extent the groups you have are explained by sequence composition.
